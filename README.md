# CONTROL
This repository contains implementations of various process control systems using Arduino, Python, and MATLAB. It includes PID controllers, on-off control systems, and advanced control algorithms for temperature, pressure, flow, and level control applications.
# Features
Multi-platform implementations: Arduino (embedded), Python (simulation/analysis), MATLAB (control design)
## Control algorithms:
  1. On-Off control
  2. PID control (standard and variations)
  3. Model Predictive Control (MPC)
## Process simulations:
  1. Temperature control (heater/cooler)
  2. Liquid level control
  3. Flow control
## Data logging and visualization

# Hardware interfacing examples
 - Arduino Uno/Mega/Nano
 - Sensors (temperature, pressure, flow, level depending on application)
 - Actuators (relays, pumps, valves, heaters)
 - Interface components (LCD displays, buttons)
